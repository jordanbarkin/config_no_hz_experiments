# cs261-project

To build all benchmarks, run:
```
cd src

make all
```

To run all benchmarks, use `src/calibrate.cpp` to set the cycles for each phase duration in `src/run_benchmarks.sh`.

Then run
```
./run_benchmarks.sh
```

Modify trials, phase duration, number of cores, and filenames as you see fit for your configuration.
